						<p>2.1 Because we believe it is important to make proper arrangements with you when you purchase products through our website, we have written these General Terms and Conditions. These conditions apply to our relationship and this from your purchase. Therefore, at the time of purchase, you are expressly requested to confirm your agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you are unable to accept these terms and conditions, we understand that. From our side, we can only allow you to make a purchase once you have accepted our conditions.</p>
						<p>2.2. These terms and conditions are not final and therefore we reserve the right to change these terms and conditions periodically. For that reason, prior to any purchase you make, you will be asked again to read and accept the General Terms and Conditions. By accepting them, you ensure that the most recent version of the general terms and conditions applies, both to the provisions relating to the Purchase and to those relating to your account.</p>
					</section>

						<section className={style.textContainer}>
							<h4 className = {style.titleContainer}>ARTICLE 3 REGISTRATION</h4>
						<p>3.1 In order to purchase Products through the Web Shop, You must first register. The Registration procedure is explained in more detail on the Website.</p>
						<p>3.2 You may only register once and will receive unique login details. These login details are strictly confidential and intended for Your own use.

						<p>3.3 During Registration, you are expected to provide all current, complete and correct personal data and you undertake to notify us in writing of any changes prior to each Purchase. You shall indemnify us for any damage that will result from the communication of incorrect, non-current and/or incomplete data, or from the lack of communication of any changes. If these data contain personal data, they will be processed in accordance with our privacy policy.</p>
					</section>

							<p>4.1 The products offered in the Web Shop are available while supplies last. We are entitled to change and amend the offer.</p>
							<p>4.2 If we show a model, sample or example through the Web Shop, this is for illustrative purposes only. The Products may differ from the model, sample or example.</p>
							<p>4.3 We reserve the right to correct the prices on our Website, including in the event of any material or other error.</p>
					</section>

						<section className={style.textContainer}>
							<h4 className = {style.titleContainer}>ARTICLE 5 PRICES</h4>
							<p>5.1 The Prices of the Products are always considered to be stated in EURO and are inclusive of VAT and other levies, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
							<p>5.2 The prices include the processing costs of the order.</p>

					</section>

						<section className={style.textContainer}>
							<h4 className = {style.titleContainer}>ARTICLE 6 PURCHASE</h4>
							<p>6.1 The Purchase of Products through the Web Shop is binding on the Buyer. The Buyer is responsible for the accuracy of any order placed. Orders are only binding on us after written order confirmation (by e-mail) from an authorised representative.</p>
							<p>6.2 In the case of a unilateral cancellation of a Purchase by the Buyer, we are entitled to compensation for damages, estimated at a flat rate of 30% of the agreed Purchase Price (incl. taxes, duties and fees), without prejudice to our right to claim compensation for our actual and proven damages. If the Buyer fails to pay this compensation, a fixed interest of 10% shall apply, counting from the date of reminder until the day of full payment of this compensation.</p>
							<p>6.3 If you are a Customer Consumer, you also have a right to compensation in the event that we unilaterally cancel a Purchase. Such compensation shall be assessed at a flat rate of 5% of the agreed Purchase Price (including taxes, duties and charges), without prejudice to your right to claim compensation for your actual and proven loss.</p>
					</section>

						<section className={style.textContainer}>
							<h4 className = {style.titleContainer}>ARTICLE 7 RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FOR CUSTOMER CONSUMER</h4>
							<p>7.1 As a Customer Consumer, you have the right to withdraw from the Purchase, without giving any reason, within a period of 14 calendar days following the delivery of the Products. The exercise of the right of return must be notified in good time to consumer.care.be@ab-inbev.com . The cooling-off period of 14 calendar days starts on the day after the delivery of the Product by the Customer Consumer. During the cooling off period the Customer Consumer will handle the product and packaging with care. If the Customer Consumer uses his right of withdrawal, he shall return the Product with all delivered accessories and - if reasonably possible - in its original condition and packaging. If the Product is damaged due to careless handling by the Customer Consumer, the Customer Consumer shall be liable for any reduction in value of the Product. We therefore draw your attention to the fact that it is best to take all precautions when opening and unpacking the Product in order to fulfil your obligation under this article.</p>
							<p>7.2 Please note that, contrary to article 7. 1, the right of withdrawal shall not apply (i) to the delivery of goods manufactured to the specifications of the Customer Consumer, (ii) to the delivery of goods that cannot be returned for hygienic reasons, (iii) to delivered goods whose sealed packaging has been broken, (iv) in the case of delivered goods that are perishable or have a limited shelf life or whose opening involves a food safety risk that makes it impossible to resell them, (v) alcoholic beverages whose price was agreed upon at the conclusion of the sales contract, but whose delivery can only take place after 30 days and whose actual value depends on fluctuations in the market, over which we have no influence. In any case, already opened packs or individual bottles or cans cannot be returned under any circumstances.</p>
							<p>7.3 The Customer-Consumer must return the product within 14 days after his timely notification of the exercise of the right of return. The Customer-Consumer must prove that the delivered product was returned in time. The date of deposit with the post office for a registered return or with a courier service will count as the only proof.</p>
							<p>7.4 THE COSTS OF ANY RETURN BY POST OR COURIER SHALL BE BORNE ENTIRELY BY THE CUSTOMER CONSUMER. SINCE WE HAVE THE PRODUCTS DELIVERED VIA A COURIER SERVICE TO MINIMIZE THE CHANCE OF DAMAGE OR LOSS, WE EXPECT THE CLIENT TO RETURN THE PRODUCTS AT LEAST BY REGISTERED POST AND TO SEND US A COPY OF THE PROOF OF REGISTERED POST IMMEDIATELY AFTER SENDING TO consumer.care.be@ab-inbev.com.</p>
